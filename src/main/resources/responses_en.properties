hello.comment=Hi @%s! I'm the Project Manager of this project. I take care of Issues' assignments, payments and more.\
              Want me to work for your project too? Go [here](https://self-xdsd.com). \n\n\
              I work primarily at Github, but I'll also start working at GitLab and BitBucket soon.
newIssue.comment=@%s thank you for reporting this. I'll assign someone to take care of it soon.
reopened.comment=@%s thanks for reopening this, I'll find someone to take a look at it again. \n\
                 However, please keep in mind that reopening tickets is a bad practice. Next time, please \
                 open a new ticket.
noAssigneeFound.comment=@%s I couldn't find any assignee for this task. This is either because there are \
                        no contributors with role ``%s`` available or because the project does not have enough funds.\n\n\
                        Please, make sure there is at least one available contributor with the required role and \
                        the project can afford to pay them.
taskAssigned.comment=@%s this is your task now, please go ahead. Deadline (when this ticket should be closed) \
                     is ``%s``.\n\n\
                     Estimation here is ``%s minutes``, that's how much you will be paid.\n\n\
                     Remember, you don't have to solve everything in this ticket - you can solve it partially\
                     and leave ``todo`` markers in the code, which will become future tasks.\n\n\
                     If you have any questions don't ask me, I'm not a technical person. Open new tickets instead.
resigned.comment=@%s ok, I'll find someone else to take care of it.
cannotResign.comment=@%s this task is not assigned to you at the moment.\
                     Only the task's assignee can ask for resignation.
deregister.comment=@%s task successfully removed.
cannotDeregister.comment=@%s you don't have the appropriate role to remove this task.\n\n\
                         Only users with PO or ARCH roles are allowed.
taskNotRegistered.comment=@%s this ticket is not registered as a task, therefore I'm not working on it\
                          at the moment.\n\n\
                          If you want me to take care of it, assign it to me or say "register".
taskNotAssigned.comment=@%s this ticket is registered as a task, I will assign it to someone soon.\
                        Needed role here is ``%s`` and estimation is ``%s`` minutes.
taskIsAssigned.comment=@%s this ticket is assigned to @%s since ``%s`` and it should be closed\
                       until ``%s``. Estimation is ``%s`` minutes.
